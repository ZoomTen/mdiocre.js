# MDiocre.js

This is a pure Node.js port of [MDiocre](https://github.com/zoomten/mdiocre).
It comes bundled with one custom parser, `mdiocre-parser-markdown` which depends on `marked`. If installed with
`npm install --production`, you should only have that one dependency.

I won't be publishing this on npm.
Audit your dependencies and keep it at a minimum. Make reinventing wheels cool again. Copy and pasting from Stack Overflow is preferrable to a random supply chain attack.
